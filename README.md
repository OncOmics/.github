  The research group, led by Prof. Tathiane Malta, is based at the Ribeirão Preto Medical School of the University of São Paulo (FMRP-USP) and is dedicated to cancer research through integrated multi-omics and bioinformatics approaches. Our team explores various aspects of tumor biology using molecular analysis techniques, including single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

  By combining computational strategies with large-scale biological data, we aim to unravel the mechanisms driving cancer progression, tumor heterogeneity, microenvironment interactions, and therapeutic resistance. This integrative approach enables the identification of molecular signatures linked to different tumor subtypes and cellular states, offering valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.

  We are always open to collaborations and partnerships with researchers, institutions, and industry professionals eager to advance cancer research. Our group values interdisciplinary projects that explore novel analytical strategies, integrate diverse datasets, and develop innovative methodologies to deepen our understanding of tumor biology.
